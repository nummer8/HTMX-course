# HTMX-course
These are a set of small programs to accompanie the course on 
UDEMY https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-htmx-course/

I did not create this course.
I simply converted the software from javascript (server) to Freepascal.

The original software can be found at https://github.com/coderonfleek/htmx-course

To get this repo working you have to compile the project in the laz-server directory and run it.
Start a webbrowser and point it to httplocalhost:3000/chapter1/index.html
From there you can open any of the given html files.

Check the separate html files and the server source-code for more info.

The demo for websockets is not implemented in freepascal.
