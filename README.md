# HTMX-course
These are a set of small programs to accompanie tthe course on UDEMY https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-htmx-course/
I did not create this course I simply converted the software from javascript (server) to Freepascal
The original software can be found at https://github.com/coderonfleek/htmx-course
To get this repo wiorking you have to compile the project in the laz-server directory and run it.
Start a webbrowser and point it to httplocalhost:3000/chapter1/index.html
From there you can open any of the given html files.
Check the separate html files and the server source-code for more info.
This is not a complete course it is just a set of file that can help you.
The demo for websockets is not implemented in freepascal.
